## Map data & services

### POI data — OpenStreetMap (ODbL 1.0)

POI discovery queries the **Overpass API** against OpenStreetMap data.

- Data: **© OpenStreetMap contributors**, licensed under the
  [Open Database License 1.0 (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/).
  Free for commercial use; attribution is required and must accompany published
  maps and shared data extracts. The tool shows it in the map attribution and adds a
  source note to the POI XLSX export.
- Service: the public Overpass instances used
  (`overpass-api.de`, `overpass.kumi.systems`, `overpass.private.coffee`, `overpass.openstreetmap.fr`)
  are donation-funded community infrastructure operated under fair-use policies.
  Moderate interactive use (as in this tool) is fine; sustained heavy or automated
  load should move to a self-hosted Overpass instance.

### Basemap — "Positron" style via OpenFreeMap

The background map is the **Positron** style (the open-sourced design originally by
CARTO, [BSD-licensed style repo](https://github.com/openmaptiles/positron-gl-style)),
served as vector tiles by **[OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org)** and rendered
client-side by MapLibre GL:

- **OpenFreeMap** — public instance is free of charge **including commercial use**,
  no API keys, no usage caps (donation-financed; self-hosting supported if ever needed).
- Map schema **© [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org)**; data
  **© OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL 1.0)**.
- Required attribution (shown in the map's attribution control):
  **OpenFreeMap · © OpenMapTiles · Data © OpenStreetMap contributors**

**Raster fallback** (no WebGL / style unreachable): OSM standard tiles
(`tile.openstreetmap.org`), grey-tinted via CSS. Data ODbL as above; the tile service
is OSMF community infrastructure under the
[OSMF Tile Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/)
(interactive light use is fine; heavy/wide distribution should use its own tiles).
